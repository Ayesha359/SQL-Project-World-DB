# üóÑÔ∏è Customer Churn Analysis: SQL Data Preparation & Querying üìâ

This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for a database project focused on **Customer Churn Analysis**. This project forms the foundational data layer for understanding customer attrition, enabling subsequent analysis and dashboard creation (like the Power BI dashboards demonstrated in accompanying visuals).

## ‚ú® Project Overview

The goal of this SQL project is to:

* **Structure and Manage Customer Data:** Define tables to store comprehensive customer information.
* **Identify Churn Indicators:** Store and manage data points relevant to predicting and understanding customer churn.
* **Enable Data Extraction:** Provide clear SQL queries for extracting, transforming, and loading data for business intelligence tools and further analysis.
* **Support Churn Insights:** Facilitate the exploration of relationships between customer attributes, service usage, and churn behavior directly within the database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components & Data Schema (Conceptual)

While specific table names and structures may vary, a typical database for customer churn analysis would involve tables like:

### `Customers` Table (Conceptual Example)
Stores core customer demographic and account information.

| `OnlineSecurity`   | BIT       | Has online security?                          |
| `OnlineBackup`     | BIT       | Has online backup?                            |
| `DeviceProtection` | BIT       | Has device protection?                        |
| `TechSupport`      | BIT       | Has tech support?                             |

| `StreamingMovies`  | BIT       | Has streaming movies?                         |

### `Contracts` Table (Conceptual Example)
Details about customer contracts and billing.
| Column Name      | Data Type | Description                                   |

## üíª Example SQL Commands & Queries

This section demonstrates common SQL operations relevant to churn analysis:

* **Retrieve all churned customers with their contract type:**
    ```sql
    SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Gender, co.ContractType
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Contracts co ON c.CustomerID = co.CustomerID
    WHERE c.Churn = 1;
    ```

* **Calculate churn rate by contract type:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        ContractType,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN c.Churn = 1 THEN c.CustomerID END) AS ChurnedCustomers,
        COUNT(c.CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers,
        CAST(COUNT(CASE WHEN c.Churn = 1 THEN c.CustomerID END) AS DECIMAL) * 100 / COUNT(c.CustomerID) AS ChurnRate_Percentage
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Contracts co ON c.CustomerID = co.CustomerID
    GROUP BY ContractType
    ORDER BY ChurnRate_Percentage DESC;
    ```

* **Find customers with Fiber Optic Internet who have churned:**
    ```sql
    SELECT c.CustomerID, c.Age, c.TenureMonths
    FROM Customers c
    INNER JOIN Services s ON c.CustomerID = s.CustomerID
    WHERE c.Churn = 1 AND s.InternetService = 'Fiber optic';
    ```

* **Update a customer's churn status (e.g., if re-engaged):**
    ```sql
    UPDATE Customers
    SET Churn = 0 -- Set to 0 for retained
    WHERE CustomerID = 12345;
    ```

## üöÄ Getting Started (Conceptual)

To set up a similar database:

1.  **Database System:** Choose a relational database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite).
2.  **Schema Creation:** Run DDL (Data Definition Language) scripts to create the `Customers`, `Services`, and `Contracts` tables (or similar tables relevant to your data).
3.  **Data Loading:** Import your raw customer churn data into these tables using `INSERT` statements or bulk import tools.
4.  **Query & Analyze:** Execute SQL queries to analyze the data, extract insights, and prepare data for BI tools.
